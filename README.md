# Quantum Dynamics: Harmonic Oscillator Wave Packet Propagation

## Overview

This project extends a quantum dynamics tutorial developed by Prof. Arjan Berger for the LTTC Winter School. The original framework propagates a Gaussian wave packet using the **split-operator method**. My contribution replaces the Gaussian initial state with a wave packet constructed as a **superposition of quantum harmonic oscillator eigenstates**, and investigates how different coefficient choices affect the dynamics.

## Background & Attribution

The base propagation code and tutorial were created by **Prof. Arjan Berger**, inspired by:
- Tanner, J. J., *J. Chem. Education* 67, 917 (1990)
- Original Fortran program by Anders Sandvik (Boston University)

The tutorial exercises covered Gaussian wave packet propagation, norm and energy conservation, autocorrelation functions, and eigenvalue spectra. This repository contains my **graded homework extension** built on top of that framework.

## My Contributions

### Task 1 — Hermite Polynomial Recursion
Implemented a `hermite_poly` subroutine computing Hermite polynomials Hₙ(y) via the three-term recursion:

```
H₀(y) = 1
H₁(y) = 2y
Hₙ(y) = 2y·Hₙ₋₁(y) − 2(n−1)·Hₙ₋₂(y)
```

### Task 2 — Harmonic Oscillator Eigenstates
Modified `initpsi` to compute eigenstates φₙ(x) for n = 0 to 4 using the analytic formula:

```
φₙ(x) = 1/√(2ⁿ n!) · (mω/πℏ)^(1/4) · exp(−mωx²/2ℏ) · Hₙ(√(mω/ℏ) · x)
```

### Task 3 — Superposition Wave Packet
Built the initial wavefunction as a weighted sum:

```
Ψ₀(x) = Σ c(n) · φₙ(x),  n = 0..4
```

Coefficients are read from the external `coefficients` file, making it easy to test different configurations without recompiling.

### Task 4 — Normalization
Added a normalization block at the end of `initpsi` that computes the norm via discrete integration and rescales Ψ₀(x) to satisfy ∫|Ψ₀(x)|²dx = 1.

### Tasks 5 & 6 — Physical Validation & Case Studies
Validated the code by propagating a pure eigenstate (only one non-zero coefficient) and confirming that the probability density remains unchanged over time — only a phase factor is acquired, as expected.

Three coefficient configurations were then compared:

| Case | Coefficients | Symmetry | Behaviour |
|------|-------------|----------|-----------|
| 1 | All equal to 1 | None | Complex beating pattern, multiple interference peaks |
| 2 | Even only (c₀, c₂, c₄ = 1) | Even (symmetric about x=0) | Regular, symmetric oscillation |
| 3 | Odd only (c₁, c₃ = 1) | Odd (antisymmetric) | Node at x=0, period set by E₃−E₁ gap |

## How to Compile and Run

Requires `gfortran` and optionally ImageMagick for animated GIF output.

```bash
# Compile
gfortran propagate-modified.f90 graphics.f90 dfft.f -o propagate

# Run (from a working directory containing the input files)
./propagate

# Convert snapshots to animated GIF (optional)
convert -set dispose previous -delay 20 psi*.ps output.gif
```

## Academic Context

This work was completed as part of the **Quantum Dynamics module** at the [LTTC Winter School](https://www.lttc.cnrs.fr/), January 2025, held in Aspet, France — an intensive course within the **TCCM European Master's programme** (Theoretical Chemistry and Computational Modelling).
